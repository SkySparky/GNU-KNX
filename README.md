# GNU-KNX
Revising the existing KNX project to run between Windows and Linux, compiled with the GCC compiler.

This project, written in the C language (as opposed to c++ in the previous incomplete iteration)
has adopted the GPL 3.0 license, in addition to extending support towards linux distributions
for 64 and 32 bit platforms.

In addition, the source code will now be designed for compilation on the gcc compiler,
and follows the 2014 C standard.
